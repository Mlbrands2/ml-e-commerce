-----Categorizing livestock on your online livestock trade website is a critical step to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience for your users. The categories and types should align with the common practices in livestock trading while considering the local market in Tanzania or your target market.

### **Suggested Categorization Framework**

#### **1. High-Level Categories**
Start with broad categories based on the type of livestock. These could include:
- **Cattle**
- **Goats**
- **Sheep**
- **Poultry**
- **Pigs**
- **Camels**
- **Fish** (for aquaculture)
- **Other Livestock** (e.g., rabbits, donkeys, etc.)

---

#### **2. Subcategories by Purpose or Type**
For each high-level category, create subcategories based on the purpose or type of the livestock. This helps buyers narrow down their choices. Here are examples:

- **Cattle**:
  - Dairy Cattle (e.g., Friesian, Ayrshire, Jersey)
  - Beef Cattle (e.g., Boran, Zebu, Angus)
  - Draft/Work Cattle
  - Young Stock (e.g., calves)
  - Bulls (for breeding)

- **Goats**:
  - Dairy Goats (e.g., Saanen, Toggenburg)
  - Meat Goats (e.g., Boer, Kalahari Red)
  - Mixed Purpose
  - Young Goats (e.g., kids)

- **Sheep**:
  - Meat Sheep (e.g., Dorper)
  - Wool Sheep (if relevant)
  - Breeding Sheep
  - Lambs

- **Poultry**:
  - Layers (egg-laying hens)
  - Broilers (meat chickens)
  - Local Breeds (e.g., "kienyeji" chickens)
  - Ducks
  - Turkeys

- **Pigs**:
  - Breeding Pigs
  - Meat Pigs
  - Piglets

- **Fish** (for aquaculture):
  - Tilapia
  - Catfish
  - Fingerlings

- **Camels**:
  - Dairy Camels
  - Breeding Camels
  - Meat Camels

#### **3. Additional Filters**
Use filters to further refine the search. Examples include:

1. **Breed**: Allow users to filter by specific breeds within a category.
   - Example: "Friesian" under Dairy Cattle or "Boer" under Meat Goats.
   
2. **Age Group**: Group livestock by age, such as:
   - Young (e.g., calves, kids, lambs, chicks)
   - Mature (e.g., fully grown animals)
   - Old (e.g., for low-cost purchase or specific purposes)

3. **Gender**:
   - Male (e.g., bulls, bucks, rams)
   - Female (e.g., cows, does, ewes)

4. **Condition/Purpose**:
   - Breeding
   - Slaughter
   - Pets (e.g., rabbits)

5. **Price Range**: Users can select livestock based on their budget.

6. **Location**: Buyers can filter by region or district (e.g., Dar es Salaam, Mbeya, Arusha).

7. **Health Status**:
   - Vaccinated
   - Non-vaccinated
   - Special needs (if applicable)
